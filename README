  Hi, 
  This is a FLASH4 setup, along with a Gravity Unit (see the Roche directory),
  it is meant to simulate accretion from one WD to another through Roche lobe overflow. 

  Some notes:
  1. Problem does not use self gravity, it depends on a  gravity unit called Roche. 
  2. To use the gravity unit, put it in source/Gravity/GravityMain/Roche. 
  3. After initial calculations, the code dumps some useful parameters in the files
  - rho.par - Stores some results from the Lane-Emden solver.
  - initial_don_profile.dat - Saves the donor profile.
  - initial_acc_profile.dat - Saves the accretor profile.

- I had some muffins, a lot of time and the inability to sleep,
  this led to building the whole code in a single Friday night, 
  with some advances during the rest of the weekend.
- Centrifugal and Coriolis terms of the Roche field have been corrected.
- Full Roche field stored in new gravity unit Roche,
  it was a really good Friday.
- Driver_dourceTerms modified to add material refilling and initial relaxation.
  Saturday morning was interesting too. 
- Maybe I should go outside.

- Figured out simple git things, about to add real stuff.
- I haven't gotten the rotation to work well yet.
